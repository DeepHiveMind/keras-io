# Deep_NeuralNet_AI_Applications_Keras_TF2.0



It has focused demonstrations of vertical deep learning workflows.

All of the examples in this repo are written as Jupyter notebooks and can be run in one click in Google Colab, a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup and runs in the cloud. Google Colab includes GPU and TPU runtimes.
